st.markdown("""
FidSync is an internal web application built for our team to make working with fund documents easier and faster.

Traditionally, updating fund scorecards means:
- Reading through long PDF investment reports
- Manually copying fund status data
- Finding the correct cells in Excel templates
- Hoping you didn’t miss anything

**FidSync automates all of that.**  
It reads the reports for you, finds the fund statuses, matches them to the right rows in Excel, and color-codes them with Pass/Fail — all in one click.

It’s secure, internal-only, and designed specifically for wealth management workflows like ours.

If you ever have questions, ideas, or issues — use the **User Requests** tab to get support.
